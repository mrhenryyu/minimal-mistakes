# Getting a phone plan in Montreal

Most students that come to McGill are not from Montreal. Some students have phone  plans that they continue to use here in Montreal, from another Canadian city. But if you are from the states or anywhere else, or if you need to change your phone plan, I hope that this guide gives you some information for you to make an informed decision.

Before you consider looking plans at all, you have to consider two things: your phone and your mobile needs

My Current Plan 

	
Your phone 
Are you satisfied with your current phone? Are you okay using your phone for the next year, or even two years. If the answer is yes, then you would be looking at bring your own phone plans. However, sometimes there are some VERY good deals for getting a new phone on a contract, but expect to pay some more per month in your plan for that new phone. 

Next, is your phone unlocked? Does it have the necessary hardware comparable with Canadian carriers? You can check this easily as well. If you received your phone as part of a contract, chances are that it is not unlocked (I. E.  Locked to your carrier). If you paid for your phone outright (I. E.  From apple), it is unlocked. 
Does your phone have the wireless bands comparable with a Canadian carrier? 
Google your phone model (GSM ARENA), and compare that with the bands that the carriers have (links) If they are compatible, you are good to go. A good rule of thumb is that the three largest phone carriers in the US are usually compatible with a big-3 Canadian carrier. 

Needs
Everyone uses their phones to different extents. Some don't use it at all, while others (we all know the one) have their eyes glued to their phones 24/7 and only unglue their eyes to take a selfie. These users have different data needs, and it is important for you to have an idea of how much data / minutes / other features you need so that you can narrow down the choices available. If you don't, the huge amount of choices will make you confused. 

I break down the major things to consider: 
Minutes: 
- Most carriers offer free evening + weekend minutes and so the only time you would actually need to use your minutes is from 9am - 5pm on a weekday. As such, the number of minutes that most carriers offer are actually more than enough for you to get through the month. In addition, there are many things such as VOIP, or Google Voice or other services that allow you to use your internet connection to call people (and your minutes won't be used) 
- a specified amount of minutes vs "unlimited minutes". Now, how many minutes do you actually need? Do you really talk that much to warrant buying an unlimited minutes plan? If you talk less than 1000 minute a month (You call clients on a daily basis, or you for some reason actually call instead of using google hangouts / Skype. 
- Local Minutes vs Canada - wide minutes
	This is actually a huge deal to many people as Canadians usually have friends back home etc that they want to call. 
- Coverage
	This is actually a huge factor for people that leave Montreal often. Certain cellphone companies have better coverage. The big 3 and their subsidiaries (Rogers, Bell, Telus) all have really good Canada Wide Coverage. If you go with a smaller company, e.g. Videotron, Wind, public mobile, you will not get service sometimes in places. Furthermore, the service may even be not what you paid for even if you are in the City, sometimes, due to the lack of density of cell towers, your signal may be weaker than what it should be. Lastly, these budget cellphone providers have different "network bands" , and you have to ensure that your phone is compatible. 
- Data 
	As the bread and butter, data is the main thing you have to consider. With Facebook, twitter, youtube and browsing, you need your data with you at all times. How much do you need actually though? 

For most people, the amount of data you need is between 500MB to 2GB. I would highly avoid anything less than 500MB since web pages use so much data, that your 500MB will be used up without you even noticing it. 
As a McGill student, it all depends if you stay on campus. Campus has wifi everywhere, even though it can be very spotty sometimes and it is better to use your data for small stuff. 
 
What I paid to upgrade: 
$100 upfront for S7
$25 for hardware upgrade fee (waived)
$87 for termination of contract (waived)
$40 for case

136 + credit (2 months worth + tax) 
250 dollar credit 
25 dollar credit 

All in all, I paid a lot less for this phone than most people, and as one of the best phones ( yay IP68), it is the best. 
$63 dollar 2GB Plus 20 plan
