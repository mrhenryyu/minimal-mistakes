## Cable vs DSL 

To start off, there are two types of Internet connections. 
Cable Internet uses the TV signal to deliver Internet, and sometimes it if there is a lot of traffic in your neighbourhood, your speed can suffer. 
On the other hand, DSL Internet uses your phone line for an Internet connection. 

What about fiber? A lot of companies will offer fiber to the node (FTTN), which basically means they use fiber optic networks for their infrastructure and fiber is used until it gets to the closest access point to your neighbourhood. From there, copper wires carry the Internet signal. 

While experts make a huge distinction between the two, for the types of Internet we are getting, it doesn't matter which one you get. In general, cable Internet is more expensive than DSL, but the quality is generally the same. 

Equipment :

For you to create a wireless network, you would a modem and a router. 

Modem : a modem takes the Internet signal from the phone line and uses it to create an Internet connection. From there, you can use an ethernet connection to connect to the Web. 

Router (optional) : if you are only using ethernet connections, you don't need a wireless router. A router takes the Internet connection from the modem and creates a wireless Internet work. Usually, some modems have an included router inside, I e. They are a modem /router combo. These combos are often cheaper and easier to set up, but the router wireless signal usually is not comparable to a dedicated router.  Speed / Ping, some variance, which you should consider if you game ( PC MASTERRACE). 

For those with more than a few devices of if you are living with multiple roommates or in a large house, I highly suggest getting a dedicated router if you don't want to complain about your Internet connection. 

Buying a modem / router.  
For most students living by them selves or with 1 / 2 roommates who are not extreme media consumers (gamers, constantly steaming from Netflix) , i suggest a modem / router combination. Most modem / router combos are for DSL connections, so chance are, if you are using cable Internet, you would need both a router and a modem mostly likely. 

As a student on a budget, I advise against purchasing a new modem at best buy  or buying directly from your ISP. Those modems are extremely marked up and you might be getting one which you might not need. 

I suggest buying used modems : as they are very durable, have a long life, and are relatively cheap used on facebook groups and on kijiji. It is also to test if a modem is working.  

For cable customers,  i recommend the Thomson. 

For DSL customers, there are many choices. Which depend on the DSL connection you have. 

The DSL connection you have is different based on your speed. There is DSL, ADSL, ADSL2, VDSL, VDSL2. 

DSL : 512kbps down / 512kbps  up
ADSL: 8mbps down / 1mbps  up
ASDL2: 12mbps down / 1mbps up
ADSL2+: 24mbps down / 1mbps up
VDSL:  50 mbps down / 10 mbps up 
VDSL2: 100 mbps down / 10 mbps up
Fiber: 1Gbps down / 1 Gbps up 

However, most Canadian ISPs, at the higher speeds, DO NOT OFFER the full potential of these DSL service speeds, due to infrastructure problems etc. Check out this Wikipedia on VDSL deployments in Canada and do your research if you are going VDSL since some VDSL modems may not be compatible with certain services from Canadian companies until they improve their infrastructure.. 

Modems / Routers 
Some modems are comparable with multiple ones and some ratings are backwards comparable with each other. I group them into two tiers, ADSL and VDSL. 

VDSL modems usually cost a little more than ADSL modems. Most modems are either VDSL or ADSL comparable, not both. 

Modem recommendations: 
TP-link modems on Amazon 
- (Amazon Link) for cheap modems
	- they are relatively cheap, work effectively and contain a router as well. They have modems for different things as well. 
- Bell Modems 
	- These modems are very good. There are plenty of these modems around, and they are very good at getting the job done. Because there are so many bell customers who have either stopped using Bell, or have since switched to different tiers, these modems can be found used on the market for very cheap. You might have an old one lying around somewhere. 

	- In their default configuration, these modems are unlocked ( you can use other ISPs with these modems). However, there are certain scenarios when these modems would be LOCKED to Bell. As a 15 year Bell customer, I have gotten lots of these modems gathering dust  as Bell did not want these modems back. I paid a "modem rental fee" for the duration of my contract (they actually use to have those), and afterwards, the modem is yours and will be unlocked. However, if you steal a modem, your account is in delinquency or you do not return your modem to Bell (when they ask for it), there is a CHANCE that the modem's MAC address will be placed on a blacklist. To check, you need a user/pass from a non-bell currently active DSL account, and see if the connection is allowed (Get this info from a friend with a DSL connection) 

ADSL : 2Wire Bell modem, Bell Home Hub 1000 
VDSL: Sagemcom 2864,  Bell Home Hub 1000, Bell Home Hub 2000, Bell Cellpipe 7130 

All of these are usually good enough for students' needs. 

Routers: 
I recommend any Cisco Linksys router, TP link router. Usually, the pricier the router, the better it is for wireless internet. Make sure to get one with dual band (2.4GHz and 5.0 GHz, as most internet connections use 2.4 GHz, so there is a lot of interference on those channels. This is especially true if you live in an apartment complex. 

Companies
Major 
- Bell 
- EBOX
- Videotron 
I have been a Bell and EBOX customer for a long time. I will write another post on how to deal with these two companies specifically (here). 

Additional Charges: 

Installation Fees: Most smaller ISPs charge installation fees, since most of them use Bell networks and they have to pay Bell to get a technician into your home to set up your internet. Sometimes there are promotions to get rid of the installation fee, which you should take advantage of since installation fees usually run to the tune of $50 or more. 

Modem Rental Fees: If you don't decide to buy your modem outright, you can rent a modem from your ISP. I don't suggest you get this option, as you can find a used modem very cheaply used. And you can resell that modem after you are finished or switch Internet services. 

Dryloop Fees: Some companies have a Dryloop fee, which is a fee to maintain the telephone line if you do not have a home phone service with the same company as well. Smaller companies will have dryloop fees, but the major companies usually will not. However, they will try to get you to sign up for home phone (which you should definitely avoid as a student). 


Bell 
Widely hated and regarded as one of the most expensive and bad services. As "the" ISP, sometimes there is no avoiding them. I suggest you avoid them ( if possible), UNLESS you get either a LOYALTY plan (or extra incentives) or a promo plan (8 month student plan). They have free modems and no installation fees (if they try to charge you, call customer support to get rid of it). I've stayed with Bell for 15 years since their customer service (level 2  and up) are top notch, as they can refund you any "extra" charges that were charged. 

EBOX
A cheaper ISP than Bell, they are very good as well, prices are slightly more competitive. They have both CABLE and DSL offerings, and they offer free "dryloop" service. I currently use them and I have never had any complaints with them. They have "unlimited DSL" during off hours, which I definitely take advantage of. However, their customer service is very lean, and it is very hard to get discounts. 

Videotron
Another major carrier, prices similar to Bell but there are bundle savings if you use TV / Phone which you can take advantage of. 

Minor
- Teksavvy
- Acanac
- Cobranet 

These smaller ones are definitely something to consider if you want slower speeds for very cheap. They all have installation fees (since they have to pay a Bell technician), purchase a modem, but if you buy these cheaply, these services are cheaper in the long run. 

Read reviews about these small ISPs before choosing them. The customer service may not be up to far and the service might be risky depending on the neighbourhood.  

My Personal Recommendation: 

As a customer, I have used EBOX and Bell, so I can only tell about my experience with those two companies. I have also had friends who have used TekSavvy and have really enjoyed their service. While Bell is a nuisance to deal with at times, I've always got loyalty plans with them or special discounts after dealing with their loyalty department / customer service department). Overall, while it would have been cheaper to go with a smaller ISP, I did not want to put my parents through the hassle of dealing with changes, so we stuck with them and are still using them now. 

EBOX
I would actually heavily recommend EBOX for students. Not only do they offer competitive prices, they also are reasonable and will lower the price if you explain your ideas clearly and coherently (to a manager). In addition, if you are getting box, use my referral code: YH13 (Shameless plug). Currently in Montreal, I pay $35.99 + taxes for VDSL 25 mbps up / 10 mbps down, 225 GB bandwidth + OFF PEAK internet. I think this is one of the best deals that you can get. 

Promotion: 

If you are unsatisfied with your ISP or mobile phone service, and feel you are getting overcharged by companies, chances are that you actually are. I am an experienced negotiator and have dealt with almost all of the major telecom  / internet companies and I know how to get you to pay less on your monthly bill and to recover previous "bogus charges". 

My fees are $50 / hour, with a minimum of 1 hour. I only charge when I have reduced your bill by a total more than $50 dollars, either in immediate credits to your account, or savings on your monthly bill in the next 12 month period. Furthermore, I will never charge you more than what you are saving on your bill.
