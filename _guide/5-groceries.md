Guide 3: Food / Groceries 

In this chapter, I would like to tackle something that is difficult to discuss since everyone's food preferences and caloric requirements are inherently different, but I would like to recommend a few groceries stores / food places that will help you stretch your eating budget. 

After eating at residence for around 5000 for 8 months, it is time to reduce the amount of money you spend on groceries and at restaurants. 

If you think about the math, a pretty significant portion of your disposable income goes into food. Aside from rent, food will be the highest expense for most people (unless you are a shopaholic or a frequent bar hopper). Thus, is it important not only to budget for food but also keeping your food purchases in check (those Starbucks add up quickly) 

To ensure that you are not overspending on food, I will talk about budgeting about food, good grocery stores / places for you to get cheap food easily and eating out options 


First, make a list and only get things on that list. It is easy to get sidetracked and whatnot and spend more than you have to. So buy only what you need, since a lot of what you buy will be thrown out or unused for a long time anyways. You can save a lot by not buying more than what you need. This is why I am wary of Costco, it is only cost effective if you eat what you buy, if it is too big of a portion for you, don't get it. 

Grocery stores ; if you are a mcgill student chances are, you live in the ghetto. The two closest grocery stores are provigo and metro, both of which are overpriced since they know that you will still purchase their stuff. Fortunately they have sales frequently, so you can save money by buying the product on sale. Go to both stores and only get the things on sale. Even though this is more time consuming, you will save more money. Use an app like Flipp to check out the flyers ahead of time, while you are walking there, so you know which things are on sale at which stores. 

Good grocery stores: PA Supermarche: they have the cheapest prices and their meats / vegetables are extremely well priced. Unfortunately, you have to pick out the vegetables carefully because a lot of their produce is not as fresh as it could be (probably where the discount came from).
