# Why create your own website instead of just paying for it? 

With so many different services that allow you to quickly and effectively, such as Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress and other sites, **why do you want to go through the hassle of creating your own website from scratch (almost)**{: style="color: red"}?

For starters, lets look at the corporate offerings first: 

**Wordpress**

**Squarespace**

**Wix**

### All of these websites will be able to offer you professional looking websites 
However, that comes at a cost. 

**It costs:**

    * $5 - 20 *per year* to register a domain name for your website 
    * $5 - 10 *per month* for a hosting service 
    * $5 - 10 for additional features, such such as squarespace etc. 
    
**TOTAL COST** per year is around 100 - 150 for a website made with these professional services 

### If you have the money and want the convenience, these options are your best bet. 
However, these are downsides: 

**First**, the upfront cost isn't that huge, but if you keep your website for years, these costs will add up. And some people do not have an extra $150 per year to spend on a website. 

**Second** The website interface can be hard to use. Each of these providers have their own interface for you to design your own website, and while they have lots of functionality, there is a learning curve to get exactly what you want on your site. Even though new features are added everyday, sometimes your website provider won't have the feature that you want or you cannot change a setting of a theme. 

**Third** In order to fully customize your site to your liking, you are going to have to learn CSS and HTML and JavaScript. So if you have to learn these languages (at least at a basic level), why not just learn it and build your own website? 

### Benefits of Creating your own website 

1. It is free, 100% free. Zero money upfront, no monthly payments. 
2. You can customize it **HOWEVER** you want, you are not limited to the offerings made by other companies, as long as you know how to impliment your feature in code, you will be able to do it. 
3. It is a great learning experience. You will be learning various programming languages and concepts such as **Jekyll, Ruby, Git, command line, css, html and JS**
