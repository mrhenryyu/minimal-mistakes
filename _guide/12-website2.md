# How to create your very own website for free

**Now that we understand what the purpose of creating your own website is** it is time to start creating our own website. Please note that this is 100% free of charge as long as you are a full time student at an acredited university (and have an active university email address). 

## **Step 1** : Get the Github Student Developer Pack 

In order to get your *free* domain name, you need to sign up for the Github Student Developer Pack over at [Github.com](https://education.github.com/pack)

Included in the *Github Student Developer Pack* is access to a free .me domain (1 year) with NameCheap. This is what we are going to use to get our domain name. 

> Check out the other **offers** included in the Student Developer Pack. The tools available are extremely useful for hosting web apps, learning new languages and storing private Github repos. 

## **Step 2** : Get your NameCheap **.me** domain name

Use the affiliate link provided in the Github Student Developer Pack to get your free domain name. Choose a professional domain, such as your name (mine is henryyu.me). No credit card required. When you sign up for your domain, select to host your website using Github Pages. That is what we are going to use to set up the website.

## **Step 3** : Get Github Pages set up 

Now that you have your domain set up, you need set up a Github account. If you don't have one, sign up using your education email address. The *Github Student Developer Pack* lets you get unlimited private repositories, which is great if you do not want your website code to be widely available to the public. 

Github has a very comprehensive guide on how to set up your own Github Pages website. There are many free templates for beginners on their website. They also have their own editor (similar to Wordpress) where you can add text and links and photos to your site. If you want to customize your site even further there are two options you can do.

### **Option 1** : Code your own Website 

Now, this option sounds very daunting. Learning HTML from scratch is pretty daunting and it takes a many hours learning CSS, HTML, Javascript and Jekyll to build your own website. If you would like the learning opportunity, GO FOR IT! 

Please note that Github Pages does not support PHP. The language that it uses is Jekyll, a Ruby Gem made for displaying webpages. Check out how [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and its documentation. It is fairly easy to use, and uses the same backbone as many other Ruby gems, so it is a good precursor to Ruby on Rails (RoR).

### **Option 2** : Use a premade theme 

There are many *FREE* Jekyll themes available for use. The one I use is [Minimal-Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). He has a very comprehensive guide on how to install his theme and tailor most of the theme to your liking. 

Once you're done, you have your **VERY OWN WEBSITE**

> Please don't forget to support the people who provide these tools for free. Jekyll and many theme creators have their own donate link. So if you use their theme, please donate to them so that they can continue to do what they love.
