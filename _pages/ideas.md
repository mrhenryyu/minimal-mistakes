Do the McGillian's Guide to Living in Montreal 

Everyoen can tell you about how to study and do clubs at McGill, however, I want to impart some wisdom on how to live in Montreal. What you should look out for, what you should avoid, how you can get the best deals and to make the everyday nuances easier and less of a nuisance. I cover the basics, the survival items such as Internet, phones, shopping for groceries, bars, buying / selling, furniture , apartments / moving in as well as transportation. 

If you have any ideas on things I should cover, please let me know. 

Internet 

When you move out of your first year residence, or if you come straight from CEGEP, one of the first things you have to do is find an Internet provider. If you are one of the lucky few to have internet provided at your apartment, without you doing anything, consider yourself very lucky. If you are not, I hope this guide will explain to you what internet is, and what you need in order to get internet at a reasonable price. 
If you are a Montrealler, you know how bad Internet is in Montreal and in Quebec in general.
