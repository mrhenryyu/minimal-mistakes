# Greetings! 

> Thank you for taking time out of your day to check out my website. The purpose of my website is for you, the reader, to learn more about me than what is written on my resume and my Linked-In profile. I hope that I show my skills, education, passions, goals and opinions through my website and blog. Feel free to check out any of the sections below. 


{% include feature_row %}

> As a McGill student, I have spent 4 years living in Montreal and I have accumulated some knowledge over the years that I think will help new and incoming students adjust to living in this amazing city. I hope to make it easier and cheaper for students' to get their living essentials so they have more time + money to spend on their education. Some topics I touch upon are: **internet service, cellphone service, groceries, transportation, common scams, restaurants, shopping and more**{: .red}
