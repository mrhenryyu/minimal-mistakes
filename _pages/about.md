## Goals 

>People with goals **succeed**{: .red} because they know where they're going (**Earl Nightingale**)

Every single person has dreams, ambitions and goals. Various things that they wish were different, aspirations that they spend all night thinking about. However, only 3 out of every 100 adults actually **write down** their goals and aspirations on paper. 

Since people who have written down their goals are **50% more likely** to achieve their goals, it is important for me to write down my short term and long term goals. Through formulating your goals on paper, you are able to formulate a "goal plan". This is the **first step** in achieving your goals. 

### **Long Term Goal**{: .red} : Become a successful individual in an industry that involves data, technology and finance. 
My eventual goal is to develop a steady career for myself in an industry that I am passionate about, and doing something that I love. Although vague, I envision myself working a technical job and doing something that involves a mix of science, technology and finance. I am willing to put in the hard work and planning in order to make this dream a reality. 

### **Five Year Goal**{: .red} : Become a data analyst for a reputable company and work in various work environments / locations 
Within these next 5 years, I want to start to begin creating a name and a career for myself. As my core competency is in research and analysis, being a data analyst is the right fit for me. I aim to learn quickly and work hard in order to hone my skills and progress up the career ladder. As I have a finance and neuroscience background, I wish to incorporate that knowledge into my career down the line. 

### **One year goal**{: .red} : Begin working as a data analyst for a reputable firm. 
Over the next year, I want to enter the data analyst market and work for a reputable company. 

## Personal Goals 

Aside from academic goals, I have personal goals that I have set for myself, in order to improve my physical and mental health, and persona targets I would like to reach. 

### **Short term goals**{: .red}:  

1. lose weight until I hit my target weight of 175 lbs (currently 185 lbs)
2. Keep going to the gym a minimum of 5 times a week (currently going 5 times / week)
3. Sleep latest at midnight and wake up latest at 8am for a minimum of 5 times a week 
4. Maintain my ketogenic diet for 2 months (currently 1 month in)
5. Design my own Ruby on Rails application (currently in the process of implimenting)
