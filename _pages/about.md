## Goals 

>People with goals **succeed**{: .red} because they know where they're going (**Earl Nightingale**)

Every single person has dreams, ambitions and goals. Various things that they wish were different, aspirations that they spend all night thinking about. However, only 3 out of every 100 adults actually **write down** their goals and aspirations on paper. 

Since people who have written down their goals are **50% more likely** to achieve their goals, it is important for me to write down my short term and long term goals. Through formulating your goals on paper, you are able to formulate a "goal plan". This is the **first step** in achieving your goals. 

### **Long Term Goal**{: .red} : Become a successful individual in an industry that involves data, technology and finance. 
My eventual goal is to develop a steady career for myself in an industry that I am passionate about, and doing something that I love. Although vague, I envision myself working a technical job and doing something that involves a mix of science, technology and finance. I am willing to put in the hard work and planning in order to make this dream a reality. 

### **Five Year Goal**{: .red} : Become a data analyst and work in various work environments / locations 
<!--Clear having a clear / established data analyst career involving the latest technology trends, finance and involving etc. -->
Having a background in science and neuroscience, I can make a contribution on how these skills and knowledge can be combined. I know how the brain works, and I am going to use my neuroscience knowledge in data analysis. (Artifical intelligence) Having a background and neuroscience and finance, I'm looking to put the combination to a higher level / development. I can deliver superior results, I can do something that most people cannot do. 
Within these next 5 years, I want begin creating a name and a career for myself. As my core competency is in research and analysis, being a data analyst is the right fit for me. I aim to learn quickly and work hard in order to hone my skills and progress up the career ladder. As I have a finance and neuroscience background, I wish to incorporate that knowledge into my career down the line. 

### **One year goal**{: .red} : Begin working as a data analyst. 
Over the next year, I want to enter the data analyst or a data scientist.

## Personal Goals 

To compliment my academic and career goals, here are my personal goals I have set to improve my physical and mental health. 

### **Short term goals**{: .red}:  

1. Maintain a healthy weight by exercising reguarly and maintain going to the gym 5 times / week
2. Maintain a healthy sleep schedule (sleep at midnight, wake up before 8AM)
3. Design my own Ruby on Rails application (currently in the process of implimenting)
5. Blog and document my daily life.
