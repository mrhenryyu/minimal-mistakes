# My Interests

It was very difficult for me to condense my hobbies and interests into a few short paragraphs as I believe there are many components that make up my identity and personality. But for the sake of this exercise, my main interests are: technology, fitness and economics. On the other hand, my two favourite hobbies are cooking and exploring. 

## Technology 
    
Ever since I was little, I was always fascinated with technology. I remember spending hours as a child trying to understand how to use a computer and how the internal components worked. I have fond memories tinkering with my first iPod, from Jailbreaking to installing ROMS to writing short scripts. 
    
As I grew older, technology has become a larger and larger portion of my life, and today, I would not be able to live without it. To understand how to use computers better, I've learnt how to code and have taken computer science classes by on my own and in University. I conducted most of my research project using Matlab and have been familiarized with a variety of programming languages. While I do get frustrated if my code doesn't work, or if I cannot find a solution, my passion in technology keeps me motivated to continue on towards finding an answer. 

My passion also lies within computer hardware. I always loved checking out PC specs and getting a great PC and laptop for both gaming and working. I've built my current setup and you can check it out [here](/#) (will be linked when ready)

## Fitness 

When I was younger, I was pushed by my parents to pursue sports. I initially pushed into soccer and even though I was absolutely terrible (played defence in a house league), I enjoyed it. As a child, I was never too good at sports, and for the longest time, my mediocrity prevented me from actively practicing more and enjoying myself. 

That changed when I
