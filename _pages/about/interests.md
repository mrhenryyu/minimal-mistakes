# **My Interests**{: .red}


As someone who considers themselves more logically and scientifically minded, my passion and interests are in accord with my overall philosophy. My main interests are in **technology, fitness and economics**{: .red} and my hobbies are **swimming, building computers and music**{: .brown}. 

## Technology 

![image](/images/about/interests/tech.jpg)
I would like to believe that I inherited my love for all things electronic through my father, who works in the IT field. I recall spending hours as a child fascinated with the "cool things" that appeared on the CRT screen. I have fond memories tinkering with my first iPod, from Jailbreaking to installing ROMs.  

The passion for technology was, in my opinion, cultivated by using the computer for prolonged periods of time in my teenage years, despite the protest of my parents. Today, as with most millenials, I enjoy the benefits that technology provides and **I strive to educate myself on the underlying network and priciples of modern computing**. 

As part of my undergraduate education, I have learnt the principles of computer programming, algorithms and software development. I've joint the McGill Robotics Team as a *software developer* and have conducted most of my undergraduate neuroscience research project in *Matlab*{: .red}. In addition, I am familiar in *C, Java and Python*{: .red}, especially for scientific analysis *(pandas, numPy)*{: .red}. 

In addition, I am also an **avid tech junkie**, and I strive to stay informed about the newest consumer electronics and developments in ESports. 

## Sports and Fitness 

Ever since I was young, I enjoyed being outside and playing sports. Even though I was absolutely terrible (in soccer), I enjoyed it, and eventually settled into individual-sports such as swimming and cross-country running. I enjoy these sports the most as it allows me to minimize the number of external variables to depend solely on my own skill and athleticism and focus on self-improvement. 

In high school, I ran cross country and swam at a competitive level, and eventually switched to becoming an aquatic instructor and lifeguard. Currently, I am focused on weight-lifting and staying fit by going to the gym at least 4 times a week. 
    
## Economics / Markets

In high school, the class I enjoyed the most was my IB Higher Level Economics class. In university, I avidly participated in my finance classes, since I was extremely passionate about the subject. 

I enjoy economics because economics is about understanding how people behave. How populations behave and make rational decisions can be best shown through economic data.
