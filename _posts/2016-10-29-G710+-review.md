One day, I had an epiphiany to get a mechanical keyboard. I have never owned one, and when I saw a used mechanical keyboard on kijiji being sold for cheap, I immediately jumped at the opportunity. I bought the Logitech G710+ Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches. Here is my review of the product:

## Overview and Specs 
Specs: 

Cherry MX Brown Switches (with 40g accuation force and 2mm accuation travel distance) 
- My personal favourite, these switches offer a good typing experience and are not as loud as blue or red switches. 
Dual Zone Backlighting 
- The WASD/arrow keys and the rest of the keyboard backlight can be adjusted separately, with 4 different brightness levels 
Media and Macro Keys 
- the keyboard comes equipped with media keys (for play/pause/skip) and volume control. In addition, they come with 6 programmable macro keys with three different configuration of macros. 
Minor Additions 
- Game Mode Switch 
	- this toggle allows you to disable the windows key to prevent you from switching into your desktop during a gaming session. I personally do not see the benefit of this addition, but more experienced gamers might. 
- 26 key rollover and 110 anti-ghosting 
	- these were in place to ensure that no bad inputs or missed inputs are present and allows the keyboard to correctly execute your commands. 
- USB passthrough 
	- A USB passthrough port is located on the keyboard(ideally for a headset or a USB stick) to help with cable management. 

## First Impressions and Review 

### First Tests
After I had obtained the keyboard, I was extremely giddy about using it. For those without emchanical keyboards, it is an extremely different feeling typing on a mechanical keyboard for the first time after spending your entire life typing on membrane keyboards. Your fingers feel sharp, like pistons on a car, churning a masterpiece as you type 100 words per minute. Going back to your membrane keyboard, it now feels mushy and slow, and your fingers feel like they are hindered by the vastly inferior membrane "switches". Overall, my first impressions were very positive as there were a lot of great features and only a few minor nuances with this keyboard. 

### Size 
One thing that I immediately noticed about this keyboard is that this is not a sleek and compact mechanical keyboard. This will not fit on a very narrow desk or in tight fitting spaces. The macro keys and media keys add a lot of extra size and weight to the keyboard, but these provide additional features will be extremely useful for many users. I don't tend to use the macro keys myself very much, but I do use the media keys (play / pause) when I watch a movie etc. 

With its large size, this keyboard should be fairly cemented in place on the desk, but it has an included wrist rest, which some keyboard manufacturers do not actually include. 
Very heavy
- USb Passthrough 

Typing experience: overall good, gaming wise , 
macro keys: not too much used 

Typing software: don't need 

Illumination: wasd keys unnecessary 
A lot of features are not used for me, and I would rather have preferred a smaller form factor 

wrist rest is a good addition: and makes it comfy 
you can use your own if you want 

functionality: very good
- moveability, portability bad 
## Pros and Cons 

### Pros 
1. Good Typing Experience 
    Obviously this depends a lot on your personal preference. Some people like Cherry MX Blues, or reds, but for me, the legitimate cherry MX brown switches are the most comfortable to write on. the spacing between the keys are good, and the overall feel of the key caps (although ABS plastic) are very decent. The keys do not smudge off and oil residue is mostly non-existent.
2. Comfortable
