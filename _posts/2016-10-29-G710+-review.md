One day, I saw a used mechanical keyboard on kijiji being sold for cheap, I immediately jumped at the opportunity. I bought the Logitech G710+ Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches for around $70, and was thankful that it was in an extremely good condition, almost new. Here is my review of the product:

## **Overview and Specs**{: .purple}

**Specs:**

## First Impressions and Review 

### First Tests
After I had obtained the keyboard, I was extremely giddy about using it. For those without mechanical keyboards, it is an extremely different feeling typing on a mechanical keyboard for the first time after spending your entire life typing on membrane keyboards. Your fingers feel sharp, like pistons on a car, churning a masterpiece as you type 100 words per minute. Going back to your membrane keyboard, it now feels mushy and slow, and your fingers feel like they are hindered by the vastly inferior membrane "switches". Overall, my first impressions were very positive as there were a lot of great features and only a few minor nuances with this keyboard. 

One thing that I immediately noticed about this keyboard is that this is not a sleek and compact mechanical keyboard. This will not fit on a very narrow desk or in tight-fitting spaces. The macro keys and media keys add a lot of extra size and weight to the keyboard, but these provide additional features will be extremely useful for many users. I don't tend to use the macro keys myself very much, but I do use the media keys (play / pause) when I watch a movie etc. 

With its large size, this keyboard should be fairly cemented in place on the desk, but it has an included wrist rest, which some keyboard manufacturers do not actually include. 

## Pros and Cons 

### Pros 
1. Good Typing Experience 
    Obviously this depends a lot on your personal preference. Some people like Cherry MX Blues, or reds, but for me, the legitimate cherry MX brown switches are the most comfortable to write on. the spacing between the keys are good, and the overall feel of the key caps (although ABS plastic) are very decent. The keys do not smudge off and oil residue is mostly non-existent.
2. Comfortable 

### Cons 

1. **No RGB Lighting**{: .red}

All of the high-end mechanical keyboards released in the past year-and-a-half have included some soft of RGB LED backlighting in either zones or individually backlit keys. The Logitech G710+ has only white backlighting, which will not be as aesthetically pleasing to certain people. 

2. **Large and Bulky**{:.red}

Let's face it, this keyboard is large and bulky. As one of the largest mechanial keyboards in terms of size, the Logitech G710+ uses a large amount of desk real estate, which can be used for other things. This tradeoff provides additional functionality such as **macro keys, media controls, wristrest and USB passthrough**{: .green} at the expense of **a sleek and slim design**{: .red}. This keyboard is geared towards workstation and productivity usage, not for gaming. 

3. **Small Details and Features**{: .red}

This might be nit-picking, however there are several missing features found on competitors that are not found on the Logitech G710+. 
  - **ABS Plastic Keycaps**: Logitech uses the cheaper, lightweight ABS plastic keycaps instead of the more expensive and more durable **PBT keycaps** 
  - **No Braided Cable**: The keyboard cable is long, but is covered in plastic, which has a cheaper feel than a black braided cable as seen in competitor keyboards 
  - **Bulky Cable**: In addition to the plastic coating of the cable, the cable is very bulky and not very flexible, which provides a large inconvenience if you want to place your keyboard in a tight space. In addition, there is no option to remove/replace the cable, as the cable is fixed to the keyboard.

## **Final Conclusion and Score**{: .green}

In conclusion, we have a 


# **Overall Score: 8/10**{: .orange}
