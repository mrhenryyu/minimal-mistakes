One day, I had an epiphiany to get a mechanical keyboard. I have never owned one, and when I saw a used mechanical keyboard on kijiji being sold for cheap, I immediately jumped at the opportunity.

## First Impressions and Review 

After I had obtained the keyboard, I was extremely giddy about using it. For those without emchanical keyboards, it is an extremely different feeling typing on a mechanical keyboard for the first time after spending your entire life typing on membrane keyboards. Your fingers feel sharp, like pistons on a car, churning a masterpiece as you type 100 words per minute. Going back to your membrane keyboard, it now feels mushy and slow, and your fingers feel like they are hindered by the vastly inferior membrane "switches". 

- Size
Very heavy

- USb Passthrough 

Typing experience: overall good, gaming wise , 
macro keys: not too much used 

Typing software: don't need 

Illumination: wasd keys unnecessary 
A lot of features are not used for me, and I would rather have preferred a smaller form factor 

wrist rest is a good addition: and makes it comfy 
you can use your own if you want 

functionality: very good
- moveability, portability bad 
## Pros and Cons 

### Pros 
1. Good Typing Experience 
    Obviously this depends a lot on your personal preference. Some people like Cherry MX Blues, or reds, but for me, the legitimate cherry MX brown switches are the most comfortable to write on. the spacing between the keys are good, and the overall feel of the key caps (although ABS plastic) are very decent. The keys do not smudge off and oil residue is mostly non-existent.
2. Comfortable
