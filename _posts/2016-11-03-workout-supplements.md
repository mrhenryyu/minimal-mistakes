# Workout Supplements 

### After taking a few workout supplements, here are my thoughts on which supplements are healthy and provide seeable results

## Table of Contents 

1. Warning + TL:DR 
2. Good Supplements
3. Maybe Supplements
4. Bad Supplements
5. Special Cases + My "STACK" 


First of all, please note that I am not sponsored by any Nutrition company and I am not trying to pursuade you to purchase products that may be harmful to your body. Before purchasing, please conduct your own research (I will provide links to additional resources if you're interested). What has worked for me might not work for you, since each person has different metabolic rates and different tolerances to substances ( e.g. caffeine), so results are not guaranteed. 


## Warning + TL:DR 

Before I talk about any supplement in general, I want to warn you that there are no miracle pills, no special formula and no shortcut to fitness. The products that I will be discussing are called supplements. They are not called "necessities" and you do not have to use them at all. They are not miracle pills and the only benefit that they help you accelerate the fitness process by around ~20 % (my estimates, not research backed). Most of these products help your mental state / have psychological benefits to help you focus / train harder, but by themselves, have no long-lasting change in your body. 

In my opinion, the only successful fitness plan is dicipline, dedication and determination (the 3D's). "Supplements" are only what their name implies: they are there to "supplement" fitness regiment as they will do nothing by themselves. There is no alternative to the fundamentals of a healthy lifestyle: regular exercise, good sleep and a clean and healthy diet. In fact, if you have those three things, you don't need supplements at all: a "clean build" or "clean bulk". Supplements, at the end of the day, are very expensive and are only there to provide you that little bit extra, but are completely not mandatory. 

## Supplement Rating 

I will bundle the supplements into three groups: 

1. Effective{: .green}
	These supplements are simply the best supplements on the market. These are the most effective, as well as cost-effective. These supplements have the most scientific research backing their effects and are the most safe to take. 
	
2. Somewhat Effective{: .brown}
	These supplements I consider are somewhat effective. They are the most 
3. Ineffective{: .red}
