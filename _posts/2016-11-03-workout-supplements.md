# Workout Supplements 

## After taking a few workout supplements, here are my thoughts on which supplements are healthy and provide seeable results

1. Warning + TL:DR 
2. *Good* Supplements
3. *Maybe* Supplements
4. *Bad* Supplements
5. Special Cases + My "STACK" 


First of all, please note that I am not sponsored by any nutrition company and I will not be pursuading you to purchase products that may be harmful. 
Before purchasing, please conduct your own research (I will provide links to additional resources if you're interested). Also note that has worked for me might not work for you, since each person has different metabolic rates and different tolerances to substances ( e.g. caffeine). 


## Warning + TL:DR 

Before I talk about any supplement in general, I want to warn you that there are no miracle pills, no special formula and no shortcut to fitness. The products that I will be discussing are called supplements for a reason. They are not called "necessities" and none of them are mandatory. They are not miracle pills and the only benefit that they help you accelerate the fitness process by around ~20 %. Most of these products are designed to improve your your mental state  to help you focus and train harder. 

In my opinion, the only successful fitness plan is dicipline, dedication and determination (the 3D's). "Supplements" are only what their name implies: they are there to "supplement" fitness regiment as they will do nothing by themselves. 

There is no alternative to the fundamentals of a healthy lifestyle: regular exercise, good sleep and a clean and healthy diet. In fact, if you have those three things, you don't need supplements at all: a "clean build" or "clean bulk". Supplements, at the end of the day, are very expensive and are only there to provide you that little extra kick. 


## Supplement Rating 

I will bundle the supplements into three groups: 

1. **Effective**{: .green}

	These supplements are simply the best supplements on the market. These are the most effective, as well as cost-effective. These supplements have the most scientific research backing their effects and are the most safe to take. 
	
2. **Somewhat Effective**{: .brown}

	These supplements I consider are somewhat effective. They have been shown to be effective in some situations, but are either questionable in safety or are too expensive to be practical for the general public. Furthermore less research has been conducted on these supplements and very little effects have been shown. 
3. **Ineffective**{: .red}

	These supplements I would shy away from. They are either harmful for your health, have very little to no effect and are expensive. Very little scientific research has been done on these supplements or the scientific community has proven them ineffective. 
	
## **Effective Supplements**{: .green}

1. Whey Protein

This is the holy grail of supplements. Whey protein, commonly known as protein powder is derived from the byproduct of whey used in cheese production. It contains a blend of essential and non-essential amino acids blended proportionally for muscle growth. Whey protein is meant to increase your daily protein intake to meet nutritional needs. It also is a cheap and fast way to injest protein post-workout to enhance muscle growth. 
	
Numerous clinical trials and meta-analysis (analysis of several individual trials) have concluded the effectiveness of whey protein in muscle hypertrophy (growth) and its benefits in supplementating your daily protein requirements. It also prevents you from eating tons of bland chicken breast, so it's a win in my books. 
	
My advice for whey protein: get a generic whey protein (without casein or glutamine added in) and purchase it from a cheap but reputable brand. Feel free to use [*BODYBUILDING.COM*](http://www.bodybuilding.com) or [*LABDOOR*](http://www.labdoor.com) to help you make your decision.
