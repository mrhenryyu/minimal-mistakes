## TL:DR

At the start of the 2016 summer season, I have finally decided to start making a change in my lifestyle and treat my body correctly. My girlfriend pushed me to start losing weight and gaining lean muscle. Fueled by this change, I have started my fitness journey and have been going to the gym at least 5 times a week since June 2016.

I also went on a ketogenic diet for 1.5 months, starting in September, which helped significantly with weight loss. I've never been healthier, and I feel energized and motivated everyday. Now, my weight has increased back to 200lb, but with a significantly lower body fat percentage.

You must posess the will-power, not just a half-assed desire, or else you will end up with a half-assed result. No supplements or magic pills will give you the result you want, and you must find solice in something to have the dedication and motivation to keep going. 

The original spark came from my girlfriend who relently pushed me to start jogging or going to the gym. She pushed me relentlessly to get healthier and promoted it as a couples exercise. Overtime, I embraced this ideology and went to the gym every single day, rain or shine, until going to the gym was its own reward.
