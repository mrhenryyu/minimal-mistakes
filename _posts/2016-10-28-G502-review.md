# Logitech G502 Proteus Core 

![image-left](/images/blog/g502_review/mice1.png){: .align-left}
Two years ago for my birthday, my girlfriend bought me the *G502 Proteus Core* (in Oct 2014) as my first ever gaming mouse. Since then, it has been my daily driver for over 2 years, and here is my long overdue review of this gaming mouse. Since this is my first and only gaming mouse, my review might be perceived as biased, however I tried my best to remain objective.

## *Specs and Features*{: .green}
Note that the G502 Proteus Core has been discontinued in mid 2016 and has been replaced by the G502 Proteus Spectrum. However, between the two models, the only difference is the RGB lighting on the *Proteus Spectrum* (the **Proteus Core** only had blue lighting). Everything else remained the same. The G502 spectrum currently retails for around $120 CAD, and can be found on sale for around $80 - 100 CAD. 

**Update**{: .red} Christmas season 2016: The G502 Proteus Core can be found for $50 during holiday sales. 

As a high end gaming mouse from Logitech and one of the most popular/ best reviewed on the market, the G502 is one of the most ergonomic, customizable and accurate gaming mouse available on the market. While being over 3 years since its release, it is still able to compete in terms of sensor performance with current generation gaming mice. 

### **Specs**{: .brown} :

To me, and to most people, these specs might not mean anything at first glance. Different mice with similar specs might have very different feel and build quality. But out of these specs, there are a couple of things I want to highlight. 
1. **the PixArt pmw3366 sensor**
- This sensor was the combined effort of Logitech and PixArt, and the Logitech G502 was the first gaming mouse to use this sensor back in 2014. Even in today's market, this sensor is still perceived as one of the best and most accurate sensors that money can bu. This sensor has no acceleration, no smoothing, no pixel rounding, or interpolation / extrapolation, and is accurate from 200 DPI all the way to 12000 DPI. It is extremely accurate and has virtually zero input lag, and it make the mice feel extremely good. 
2. **the programmable buttons**
- When I first used the mice, I didn't know what the buttons were for. It has so many buttons that you can customize, and at first glance, that can seem daunting. However, each does have its purpose, and you can customize macros for your games (CSGO or WOW are good ones) to make it easier. You can also shift DPI (sniper mode) with a click of a button. I personally LOVE the scroll wheel. It has a button that you can press to unlock the scroll wheel, which makes scrolling and general use a lot easier. 
3. **weight**
- the G502 gaming mouse is a relatively heavy mouse, coming in at around 121 grams (most mice sit between the 80g to 100g range. However, Logitech made a smart move by allowing you to customize the weight of the mouse (+/- 18 grams) through 6 detachable weights on the bottom, after you remove the magnetic cover. I am amazed at the creative solution proposed by Logitech as this makes changing the mouse's weight extremely easy and intuitive. 

**First Impressions**

Not to be a fanboy, but I was in love with the mouse from the very beginning. I used to be a League of Legends player, and I remember playing on an old Microsoft mouse and then switching to this mouse. The sensation was completely different. You had more control of your character, you were able to move faster and more accurately, and overall, the ergonomics felt good on your hand. I tend to claw-grip my mice, and the rubber padding over the years have worn off, but even then, it still feels good on the hand. The shape of the mouse isn't too big or too small, and even for my relatively large hands, the mouse fits my hand shape without being too uncomfortable. 

In terms of usability, the clicking mechanism feels very tactile and responsive. I have never had a mis-click or a double-click. However, the clicking is fairly loud compared to some other mice, and can be distracting if you are clicking frantically. 
The scroll wheel is very well designed: the metallic gear-esque scroll wheel gives you the precision when you need it with a satisfying click-click-click or can be changed to scroll endlessly with one button press. 

### Pros / Cons 
*Pros*{: .green}
- Extremely Accurate and Responsive Sensor 
- 11 Programmable Buttons 
- Weight Adjustment 
- Scroll Wheel 

*Cons*{: .red}
- High Price ($100 for a mouse isn't usually justified, especially when you can get a mechanical keyboard or something else for that price) 
- no RGB lighting (solved with the G502 Proteus Spectrum 
- rubber padding and cable wears off after a while (I will discuss this in the next section) 
- a heavy and a non-standard look on a mouse (it looks like an armodillo, and doesn't have the rounded edges that other mouse have) 

## RMA Experience 

Unfortunately, after two faithful years with my G502, I have had some issues with this mouse. The cable sheathing has starting to fray and there have been knots and bends in the cable. Nothing was ever impacting the performance of the mouse, but it would get snagged with the other things on my desk or feel funny. In addition, the rubber grips on the mouse were wearing off due to my thumbs. 

As I was still covered under the 3 year limited warranty offered by Logitech, I went on their support website and started a support ticket. I explained my issue and attached a photo, and within 24 hours, a Logitech representative approved my RMA request, and I sent all of my relevant shipping information and they shipped me a new Logitech G502. They even sent me a G502 Proteus Spectrum (as the Core was being phased out), which I was super pleased about. 

Overall this entire process took less than 2 weeks (shipping included), and I did not have to pay for anything (shipping etc.) nor send the old mice back ( I still use it as my daily driver, despite everything) and they were extremely responsive and professional. Logitech has one of the best customer service and they truly stand behind their products. 

## Conclusion 

Overall, I absolutely love the G502 Proteus Core. This mouse was truly a combination of great engineering and design. The numerous macro keys allow for endless personalization and the feel / shape of the mouse was amazing. Logitech got numerous things right: such as the lockable scroll wheel and the sensor and the various macro buttons. There were a few hickups: such as the Logitech software not being completely functional when I first used it, but was better after software updates. That being said, after two years, the only update they made to the G502 was the addition of RGB lighting. As far as I am concerned, this is as close as you can come to a perfect mouse. 

# **Overall Score: 9.5/10**{: .green}
